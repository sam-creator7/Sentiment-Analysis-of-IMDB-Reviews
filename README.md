# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDB-Reviews

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to automatically classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their textual content.

Three different algorithms have been employed in this project to achieve this goal, namely Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes. The performance of each algorithm has been evaluated and the accuracy results are reported as follows: Gaussian Naive Bayes - 0.613, Multinomial Naive Bayes - 0.838, Bernoulli Naive Bayes - 0.814.

It is evident from the results that the Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithms outperform the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm in terms of accuracy, with the former having the highest accuracy score of 0.838.

This project serves as a starting point for sentiment analysis of movie reviews and can be further improved and expanded upon by incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques and larger datasets.
